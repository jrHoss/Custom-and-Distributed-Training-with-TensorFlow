# Custom-and-Distributed-Training-with-TensorFlow
This course is part of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI.
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques

I have uploaded the assignments that I have completed throughout this course.

The course covers:

• Tensor objects as the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow, including the difference between eager and graph modes, and how to calculate gradients using TensorFlow tools.

• Developing custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets for improved flexibility and visibility during model training.

• Generating more efficient graph code using TensorFlow's tools and understanding the benefits of running code in graph mode.

• Distributed training strategies to process more data and train larger models at a faster rate. The course will provide an overview of these strategies and allow for practice with a strategy that trains on multiple GPU cores, as well as another that trains on multiple TPU cores.
